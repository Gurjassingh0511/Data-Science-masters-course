    "Interpreting the result depends on the value of r. The value of r ranges from -1 to 1, with values closer to -1 or 1 indicating a stronger linear relationship between the two variables.

On the other hand, if the correlation coefficient is negative and close to -1, it would indicate a strong negative linear relationship, meaning that the more time a student spends studying, the lower their final exam score is likely to be.

    " To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient and the Spearman's rank correlation between the number of hours of exercise per week and body mass index (BMI), you would use the same formulas as in Q1 and Q2, respectively.

Pearson's correlation coefficient assumes that the relationship between the two variables is linear, which means that a change in one variable is directly proportional to a change in the other variable. On the other hand, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient does not assume a linear relationship and is based on the ranks of the two variables. Therefore, if the relationship"
