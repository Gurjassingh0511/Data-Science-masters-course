    "Q1. Explain the concept of R-squared in linear regression models. How is it calculated, and what does it represent?\n",
    "R-squared is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables in a linear regression model. It ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a better fit between the model and the data. R-squared is calculated as the ratio of the explained variance to the total variance, where the explained variance is the sum of squares of the difference between the predicted and actual values of the dependent variable, and the total variance is the sum of squares of the difference between the actual values and the mean of the dependent variable.\n"

    "Q2. Define adjusted R-squared and explain how it differs from the regular R-squared. \n",
    "Adjusted R-squared is a modified version of R-squared that takes into account the number of independent variables in the model. It penalizes the inclusion of irrelevant or redundant variables and provides a more accurate measure of the goodness of fit of the model. Adjusted R-squared is calculated as 1 - [(1-R^2)(n-1)/(n-p-1)], where n is the number of observations and p is the number of independent variables in the model.\n"

    "Adjusted R-squared is more appropriate to use when comparing models with different numbers of independent variables or when the number of independent variables is large. It provides a better measure of the true explanatory power of the model and can help to avoid overfitting.\n"

How are these metrics calculated, and what do they represent?MSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MSE (Mean Squared Error), and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) are commonly used metrics for evaluating the performance of regression models. RMSE is the square root of the mean of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values of the dependent variable, while MSE is the mean of the squared differences and MAE is the mean of the absolute differences.\n"

    " The advantages of using RMSE, MSE, and MAE are that they provide a clear measure of the difference between the predicted and actual values and are easy to interpret. The disadvantages are that they give equal weight to all errors, regardless of their magnitude, and can be sensitive to outliers."

    "Q6. Explain the concept of Lasso regularization. How does it differ from Ridge regularization, and when is it more appropriate to use?\n",
    "Lasso regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in linear regression models by adding a penalty term to the loss function that shrinks the coefficients of the independent variables towards zero. It differs from Ridge regularization in that it uses the L1 norm instead of the L2 norm to calculate the penalty term. Lasso regularization is more appropriate to use when the number of independent variables is large and there is reason to believe that many of them are irrelevant or redundant.\n"

    "Q7. How do regularized linear models help to prevent overfitting in machine learning? Provide an example to illustrate.\n",
    "Regularized linear models help to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function that discourages the coefficients of the independent variables from taking large values. This encourages the model to select only the most important features and reduces the risk of fitting noise or irrelevant variables. For example, in a Lasso regression model, the penalty term can set some coefficients to zero, effectively eliminating those variables from the model."

    "The limitations of regularized linear models are that they may not perform well when there is a large number of independent variables that are all relevant, or when the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is highly nonlinear. They may also be sensitive to the choice of regularization parameter, which can be difficult to tune.\n"

    "Q9. You are comparing the performance of two regression models using different evaluation metrics. Model A has an RMSE of 10, while Model B has an MAE of 8. Which model would you choose as the better performer, and why? Are there any limitations to your choice of metric?\n",
    "The choice of which model is better depends on the specific context and goals of the analysis. RMSE is a more sensitive metric that penalizes larger errors more heavily, while MAE gives equal weight to all errors. In this case, Model B has a lower MAE, indicating that it makes smaller errors on average. However, if larger errors are more important to avoid, then Model A with its lower RMSE may be preferred. One limitation of these metrics is that they do not provide information on the direction of the errors, such as whether the model tends to overestimate or underestimate the dependent variable."

Model A uses Ridge regularization with a regularization parameter of 0.1, while Model B uses Lasso regularization with a regularization parameter of 0.5. Which model would you choose as the better performer, and why? Are there any trade-offs or limitations to your choice of regularization method?\n",
    "The choice of which regularized linear model is better depends on the specific context and goals of the analysis. Ridge regularization tends to perform better when the independent variables are highly correlated, while Lasso regularization tends to perform better when there are many irrelevant or redundant variables. In this case, it is difficult to determine which model is better without more information about the data and the goals of the analysis. One limitation of these regularization methods is that they can result in biased estimates of the coefficients if the regularization parameter is not chosen carefully. Additionally, these methods may not perform well when the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is highly nonlinear."
