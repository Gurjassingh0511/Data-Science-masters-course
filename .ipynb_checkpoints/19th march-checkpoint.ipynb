    "Q1. What is Min-Max scaling, and how is it used in data preprocessing? Provide an example to illustrate its\n",
    "application.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS: Min-Max scaling, also known as normalization, is a technique used in data preprocessing to scale numeric features between a specified range (usually 0 and 1). This is done by subtracting the minimum value of the feature and dividing it by the range of the feature. The formula for Min-Max scaling is:\n",
    "\n",
    "X_norm = (X - X_min) / (X_max - X_min)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have a feature \"age\" that ranges from 20 to 60. We can apply Min-Max scaling to this feature using the above formula to scale it between 0 and 1.\n",
    "Q2. What is the Unit Vector technique in feature scaling, and how does it differ from Min-Max scaling?\n",
    "Provide an example to illustrate its application.\n",
    "ANS:The Unit Vector technique in feature scaling, also known as Normalization, scales the feature vector such that its magnitude or length is equal to 1. This is done by dividing each element of the feature vector by the L2-norm of the feature vector. The formula for Unit Vector scaling is:\n",
    "\n",
    "X_norm = X / ||X||\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have a feature vector [3, 4]. We can apply Unit Vector scaling to this feature vector using the above formula to scale it such that its length is equal to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What is PCA (Principle Component Analysis), and how is it used in dimensionality reduction? Provide an\n",
    "example to illustrate its application.\n",
    "ANS: PCA, or Principal Component Analysis, is a technique used in dimensionality reduction to reduce the number of features in a dataset while retaining most of its information. PCA achieves this by identifying the most significant features or principal components that capture the maximum variance in the data. PCA can be applied to a wide range of datasets, including image recognition, bioinformatics, and speech recognition, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have a dataset with 10 features. We can apply PCA to this dataset to reduce its dimensionality by identifying the most significant features that explain most of the variance in the data. PCA will generate a new set of features, known as principal components, that capture most of the information in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What is the relationship between PCA and Feature Extraction, and how can PCA be used for Feature\n",
    "Extraction? Provide an example to illustrate this concept.\n",
    "ANS: PCA and Feature Extraction are closely related concepts as PCA can be used for Feature Extraction. In Feature Extraction, we identify a set of new features that capture the most important information in the original dataset. PCA achieves this by identifying the principal components that capture the maximum variance in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have a dataset with 100 features. We can apply PCA to this dataset to identify the top 10 principal components that capture the maximum variance in the data. We can then use these 10 principal components as our new set of features for the dataset. This process helps reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining most of its information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. You are working on a project to build a recommendation system for a food delivery service. The dataset\n",
    "contains features such as price, rating, and delivery time. Explain how you would use Min-Max scaling to\n",
    "preprocess the data.\n",
    "ANS: To preprocess the data for the recommendation system, you would use Min-Max scaling to transform the values of each feature to a range of 0 to 1. For example, if the price feature ranges from $5 to $20, you would transform it to a range of 0 to 1 by subtracting the minimum value ($5) and dividing by the range ($20-$5= $15):\n",
    "\n",
    "New Price Value = (Price - $5) / $15\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, you would apply this transformation to each feature in the dataset to ensure that they are all on the same scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. You are working on a project to build a model to predict stock prices. The dataset contains many\n",
    "features, such as company financial data and market trends. Explain how you would use PCA to reduce the\n",
    "dimensionality of the dataset.\n",
    "ANS: To reduce the dimensionality of the dataset for the stock price prediction model, you would use PCA to identify the most important features that explain the majority of the variation in the data. You would start by standardizing the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, and then apply PCA to identify the principal components. You would choose the number of principal components based on the amount of variance they explain and the level of accuracy you require for your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. For a dataset containing the following values: [1, 5, 10, 15, 20], perform Min-Max scaling to transform the\n",
    "values to a range of -1 to 1.\n",
    "ANS: To perform Min-Max scaling on the given dataset [1, 5, 10, 15, 20] to transform the values to a range of -1 to 1, you would first find the minimum and maximum values:\n",
    "\n",
    "min = 1\n",
    "max = 20\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, you would apply the following formula to each value:\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaled Value = (Value - min) * (2 / (max - min)) - 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying this formula to the dataset, you would get the following scaled values:\n",
    "\n",
    "[-1.0, -0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. For a dataset containing the following features: [height, weight, age, gender, blood pressure], perform\n",
    "Feature Extraction using PCA. How many principal components would you choose to retain, and why?\n",
    "ANS: To perform Feature Extraction on the given dataset [height, weight, age, gender, blood pressure] using PCA, you would start by standardizing the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Then, you would apply PCA to identify the principal components that explain the majority of the variance in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of principal components to retain would depend on the level of accuracy required for the model and the amount of variance explained by each component. You can plot the explained variance as a function of the number of principal components and choose the number of components that explain the majority of the variance in the data. For example, if the first two principal components explain 90% of the variance in the data, you might choose to retain those two components."
