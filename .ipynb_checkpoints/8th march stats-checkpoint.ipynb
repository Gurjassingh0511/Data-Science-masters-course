However, the binomial distribution applies when the trials are independent and have only two possible outcomes, while the Poisson distribution applies when the number of events in a large population over a fixed interval of time or space follows a Poisson process. In other words, the binomial distribution is used to describe events that are discrete and countable, while the Poisson distribution is used to describe events that are continuous and uncountable."

The normal distribution is symmetric around the mean, so the same amount of data appears on either side of the mean. However, as we move further away from the mean, the density of the data decreases rapidly. The tails of the distribution contain the most extreme values, which occur with very low probability."
