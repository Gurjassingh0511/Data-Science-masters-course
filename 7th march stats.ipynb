For example, if there is an outlier that is much larger than the other values in the dataset, the mean will be pulled towards that value, making it a poor measure of central tendency. Similarly, outliers can increase the range, variance, and standard deviation of the dataset, making them poor measures of dispersion. For instance, consider the dataset: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 100. The outlier value of 100 will make the mean much larger than the other values, while also increasing the range, variance, and standard deviation."
