    "One common approach for anomaly detection using unsupervised learning is clustering. Clustering algorithms group data points together based on their similarity. Any data points that do not fit into any of the clusters or are too far away from the clusters are considered anomalies. For example, if we have a dataset of credit card transactions, clustering algorithms can be used to group similar transactions together based on the amount, location, time, and other factors. Any transactions that do not fit into any of the clusters or are significantly different from the clusters can be flagged as potential fraud or anomalies."
